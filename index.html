<h3>
   Bora-Bora Island
</h3>

<p>
   The island of Bora Bora rises from the <b>velvet blues</b> of the deep water up through the softer hues of the
   <b>lagoon</b> and into the air that surrounds the island. Its touch of the sea breeze tingles the skin. Its power
   fills each beat of the heart. Bora Bora is located a brief 50-minute flight from The Islands of Tahiti or Moorea.
   like Bora Bora because, with a lagoon of turquoise waters resembling an artistâ€™s palette of bright blues and greens,
   will make you feel love at first sight. while palm-covered motu circle the illuminated lagoon like a delicate pearl
   <b>necklace</b> from the islands of French Polynesia.
