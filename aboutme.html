<h1><u>IRONMAN</u></h1>
<p> 
    Iron Man possesses powered armor that offers him superhuman strength and sturdiness, flight, and an array of weapons. 
    The armor is invented and worn by Stark.Stark injects his system with modified techno-organic virus-like body restructuring machines. By rewriting his own biology, Stark is in a position to save lots of his life, gain an enhanced healing factor, and partially merge with the Iron Man armor, superseding the necessity for bulky, AI-controlled armors in favor of lighter designs, technopathically controlled by his own brain. His enhanced technopathy extends to each piece of technology, limitless and effortlessly thanks to his ability to interface with communication satellites and wireless connections to extend his "range". Some components of the armor-sheath are now stored in Tony's body, ready to be recalled, and extruded from his own skin, at will.
